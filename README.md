OU EAL Code to control Danfysik 8000 series MPS via RS-232

This code started out as our Switcher magnet control, which we then modified to talk to the Danfysik MPS.  

The Danfysik MPS in question was sold as a model 853 Series 8000, but at some point before arriving at EAL was modified with a Series 8500 control board and display.
